                            <p><strong>CMHB History</strong></p>
                            <p>In 1973 Oak Park citizens voted to establish a Community Mental Health Board and levy an annual tax for the purpose "...of providing community mental health facilities and services including facilities for the developmentally disabled and those with Substance Use Disorder." The vote was authorized Community Mental Health Act, recently passed by the by the Illinois Legislature. For the full text of the act, go to:<br><a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1499&amp;ChapAct=405%C2%A0ILCS%C2%A020/&amp;ChapterID=34&amp;ChapterName=MENTAL%20HEALTH&amp;ActName=Community%20Mental%20Health%20Act." target="_blank">MENTAL HEALTH (405 ILCS 20/) Community Mental Health Act.</a></p>
                            <p>Following the successful referendum, the Township board appointed the nine-member CMHB to carry out the duties and responsibilities of the Act. One year later a full-time executive director was hired to coordinate the day-to-day affairs, assist the voluntary Board members and add professional input and expertise to the Board's activities.</p>
                            <p><strong>CMHB Mission</strong><br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhance the mental health and developmental potential of Oak Park residents<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establish an appropriate continuum of community support service<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manage local resources in a fiscally responsible manner.</p>
                            <p><strong>Vision Statement</strong><br>
                            The Community Mental Health Board of Oak Park Township shall provide leadership to develop a comprehensive array of community based services, which are cost-effective, systematically evaluated, and responsive to evolving community needs. This requires a flexible network of easily accessible services for the treatment and prevention of mental illness, developmental disabilities, and Substance Use Disorder.</p>
                            <p>In pursuit of this vision, the board endorses the following concepts:<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessible, community focused network of care<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of a continuum of care, responsive to the community and the evolving needs of clients – children or adults<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client-centered approach to the provision of care provided in a coordinated fashion responsive to presenting issues of clients<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing choice within an array of community-based alternatives<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Services that build on client strengths as well as disabilities<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve the quality of life for Oak Park residents with disabilities</p>
                            <p><strong>Purpose and Philosophy</strong><br>
                            The Illinois Community Mental Health Act mandates that each Community Mental Health Board in the state:<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review and evaluate community mental health services and facilities<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan for programs of community mental health services and facilities<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consult with others regarding the most efficient delivery of services<br>
                            •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authorize distribution of funds to mental health services and facilities</p>
                            <p>The Board is mandated to assure on behalf of the community that those in need of mental health, developmental disability or substance use disorder services will have those services available to them. To accomplish this task the Board must continuously engage in policy development to ensure access, quality, and cost efficiency for the community’s behavioral healthcare needs.</p>
