                            <p align="center"><strong>OPENS FOR OAK PARK</strong></p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The Cook County Assessor’s office has announced that it will be accepting appeals of the assessed valuations of Oak Park properties between March 1 and April 2, 2018.&nbsp; According to Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar, this appeal period is the first of two opportunities Oak Park residents will have to appeal their assessments in 2018.</p>
                            <p>“All Oak Park properties were reassessed in 2017, and most of the values set in 2017 will remain unchanged until Oak Park’s next reassessment in 2020,” ElSaffar said.&nbsp; “Because the 2017 reassessment was such an important part of the tax process, many people believe that assessed values can only be appealed during a reassessment year.&nbsp; But since property values can change from year to year, assessed values can be appealed in any year, including 2018.”</p>
                            <p>Although ElSaffar expects to see many fewer appeals in 2018 compared to 2017, there are some circumstances where taxpayers may want to appeal this year.&nbsp; One such situation arises when the county assessor sends notices of reassessment for properties that have had significant changes in the last year, such as the construction of a new building or an addition to an existing building.&nbsp; The 2018 appeal period also allows taxpayers to bring attention to changes in the value of their properties over the last year.&nbsp; Finally, taxpayers who missed the deadline for appealing their 2017 assessed values can contest their values for the 2018 tax year.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>In most cases, those who are filing 2018 appeals because they missed the deadlines from prior years will not be able to do anything about their assessments from prior years.&nbsp; Indeed, since Cook County tax bills always arrive one year late, property owners should be aware that the money-saving effects of successful 2018 appeals will not appear on tax bills until the summer of calendar year 2019.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Individuals with concerns about their property taxes should contact the Township Assessor’s office at (708) 383-8005 to set up appointments during the appeal period.&nbsp; “The biggest point of contact between most citizens and their government arises through the payment of taxes,” ElSaffar said.&nbsp; “Oak Park residents with concerns about the fairness of this important point of contact should know that the Township is available to help residents redress tax inequities.”&nbsp;</p>
